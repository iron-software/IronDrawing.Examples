IronDrawing enables users to merge `AnyBitmap` files into multipage TIFF or GIF files, offering the flexibility to set unique dimensions for each frame within these files.

To leverage this functionality, first load all the `AnyBitmap` frames using their respective file paths, storing them in a newly initialized `List<AnyBitmap>`. Subsequently, a multipage TIFF can be crafted by invoking the method `.CreateMultiFrameTiff(List<AnyBitmap>)`, or alternatively, a GIF can be generated by utilizing the method `.CreateMultiFrameGif(List<AnyBitmap>)`.
