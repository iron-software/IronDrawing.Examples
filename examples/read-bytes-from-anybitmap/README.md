IronDrawing provides tools for handling `AnyBitmap` images by working with their byte data. Developers can **extract**, **export**, and **access** the byte data of `AnyBitmap` files.

You can initiate reading an image file by specifying its path with the method `AnyBitmap.FromFile(@"FILE_PATH")`, assigning the output to an `AnyBitmap` instance. From here, you can work with the byte data in several ways:

1. Retrieve the bytes with the `.GetBytes()` method, which pulls the byte array from the `AnyBitmap`.
2. Export the bytes while modifying the image format and adjusting the level of compression with `.ExportBytes(AnyBitmap.ImageFormat.Format, 10)`. This method allows for flexible data handling to suit various output requirements.
3. Read the entire byte data directly from the file using `File.ReadAllBytes(@"FILE_PATH")`.

Manipulating images through these methods provides a versatile approach to managing image content directly at the byte level in your applications.
