This functionality allows users to pull or capture individual frames from multi-page GIF or TIFF files and save these frames locally in various image formats. Once saved, these frames can be further edited using IronDrawing or any other tools from Iron Software as needed.

To leverage this capability, users should first transform their GIF or TIFF into an instance of the `AnyBitmap` class by opening the file through the `AnyBitmap.FromFile(@"FILE_PATH")` method. If a user needs to extract and save a specific frame and knows its index, they can utilize the `.GetAllFrames().ElementAt(n).SaveAs("FRAME_FILE_NAME")` method. For capturing the first or the last frame of the file, one may employ the `.First()` and `.Last()` methods respectively. To save every frame based on their index in the sequence, a `for` loop can be setup wherein each frame from a cached list is saved using `frames[i].SaveAs("frame_" + i + ".jpg")`.
