This functionality allows users to extract and store frames from multi-page GIF or TIFF files in any desired image format. Once saved, these frames can be edited using IronDrawing or other Iron Software tools according to the user's needs.

To leverage this capability, users should first transform the GIF or TIFF file into an `AnyBitmap` type. This is accomplished by loading the file using the `AnyBitmap.FromFile(@"FILE_PATH")` method. If users need to save a specific frame and know its index, they can employ the `.GetAllFrames.ElementAt(n).SaveAs("FILE_NAME")` method. For accessing the first and last frames, the `.First()` and `.Last()` methods are straightforward options. Users looking to save all frames can iterate through the frames using a `for` loop, saving each one with `frames[i].SaveAs("frame " + i + ".jpg")`.
