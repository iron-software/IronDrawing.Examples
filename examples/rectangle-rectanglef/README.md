IronDrawing introduces two classes designed to facilitate the drawing of rectangles at specified coordinates: `IronSoftware.Drawing.Rectangle` and `IronSoftware.Drawing.RectangleF`. These classes utilize a quartet of parameters that depict the location and dimensions of the rectangle.

Each class requires `x` and `y` coordinates as initial parameters, which represent the top-left corner of the drawing canvas. For the `Rectangle` class, these coordinates are integer values, whereas the `RectangleF` accepts floating-point numbers for more precise placement. The subsequent parameters define the `width` and `height` of the rectangle, with data types consistent with those used for the `x` and `y` coordinates. By default, the dimensions for both classes are measured in pixels.
