The capability to convert any bitmap, whether generated by a program or loaded from a user's file directory, into a memory stream enhances the usability of the bitmap in your application. This eliminates the need for temporary storage such as files or buffers. The code example below outlines an effective method to acquire a stream and demonstrates the process of converting an `AnyBitmap` file from a local directory into a memory stream.

## Obtain a Stream

This functionality allows you to retrieve a stream directly from a specified `AnyBitmap` file. Achieve this by initializing a `MemoryStream` variable and assigning it the stream extracted using the `.GetStream()` method.

## Convert to Stream

To transform an `AnyBitmap` file into a memory stream, use this straightforward procedure. Initiate a `MemoryStream` variable and assign the result of the `AnyBitmap` file that has been turned into a memory stream with the `.ToStream()` method.
