IronDrawing offers a handy capability for duplicating an `AnyBitmap`. This functionality provides a straightforward way to create a precise replica of an `AnyBitmap` object and save it independently, preserving the integrity of the original file. Additionally, users can customize their copy by selecting a specific area of the file they wish to clone. This is done by deploying the `CropRectangle` feature, which allows for saving only the desired portion of the file without altering the original.

To replicate an `AnyBitmap` object, begin by loading the desired `AnyBitmap` file, then apply the `.Clone()` method on it, and proceed to save the new instance. For using the `CropRectangle` feature, initiate the `.Clone(new CropRectangle(X, Y, Width, Height))`. Remember, `X`, `Y`, `Width`, and `Height` in the `CropRectangle` method are all measured in pixels (px).
