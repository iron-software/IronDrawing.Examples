IronDrawing offers a versatile feature called Clone AnyBitmap, allowing users to create a precise duplicate of an AnyBitmap file and save it without altering the original. Additionally, there's an option to select and copy a specific area from a file through the CropRectangle feature. This enables users to save only the chosen section of the file, ensuring the original file remains unchanged.

To clone an `AnyBitmap` file, you simply need to load an `AnyBitmap` object and apply the `.Clone()` method before saving it. If you want to use the `CropRectangle` capability, you should initialize and pass the `CropRectangle` object into the clone method like so: `.Clone(new CropRectangle(X, Y, Width, Height))`. All dimensions for `CropRectangle` are specified in pixels (px).
