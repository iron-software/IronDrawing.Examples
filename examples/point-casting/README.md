The `Point` and `PointF` classes in `IronSoftware.Drawing` were designed to align with the functionalities of other popular drawing libraries, including `System.Drawing`, `SixLabors.ImageSharp`, `Maui.Graphics`, and `SkiaSharp`. This compatibility is facilitated by allowing implicit casting between `Point` and `PointF` objects in `IronSoftware.Drawing` and these other libraries, simplifying the process of integrating and manipulating these objects within your applications.

In the provided code examples, we see how implicit casting works in practice. The first code sample shows how to cast an object from `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` to a `Point` object from a different drawing library. Conversely, the second code sample illustrates casting a `Point` from an external library to an `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` object. To employ implicit casting, you just need to assign the `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` object directly to a variable expected by the target library.

However, itâ€™s crucial to realize that this feature of implicit casting isn't universally available across all libraries. For example, casting between `System.Drawing.PointF` and `IronSoftware.Drawing.PointF` is not supported by `System.Drawing`. Nonetheless, transitions between `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` and `PointF` to formats provided by other libraries are generally supported. Specifically, when transitioning from an `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point`, the coordinate data type changes from `System.Double` to `System.Int32`. In the case of `PointF`, the `System.Single` data type remains consistent post-casting. Other notable libraries that support this kind of casting include `Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Point` and `SkiaSharp.SKPointI`.
