`Point` and `PointF` classes are integral components of the `IronSoftware.Drawing` namespace, developed to align with similar functionalities seen in other graphics libraries like `System.Drawing`, `SixLabors.ImageSharp`, `Maui.Graphics`, and `SkiaSharp`. This compatibility feature of `IronSoftware.Drawing` facilitates implicit casting between `Point` and `PointF` objects, allowing seamless interoperability and manipulation within a user's program.

The following code example illustrates how to implement implicit casting. In one instance, a `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` is converted to a `Point` from a different library, while another segment of the code demonstrates reversing this process. For implicit casting, one simply needs to assign an object of `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` to a variable from another library.

However, it's crucial to understand that implicit casting is not universally applicable across all libraries. Specifically, converting `System.Drawing.PointF` to `IronSoftware.Drawing.PointF` is not executable, as it is unsupported by `System.Drawing`. Nonetheless, conversions from `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` and `PointF` to types from other libraries are achievable. In these conversions, when using `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point`, the coordinate’s data type shifts from `System.Double` to `System.Int32`, but the `PointF` maintains its `System.Single` data type through the casting process.
