The `Point` and `PointF` classes in `IronSoftware.Drawing` were designed to mirror the capabilities found in various other drawing libraries, including `System.Drawing`, `SixLabors.ImageSharp`, `Maui.Graphics`, and `SkiaSharp`. This design choice facilitates the implicit conversion of `Point` and `PointF` objects, streamlining their use across different libraries and enhancing user manipulation within the application.

The code examples shared illustrate how this implicit conversion functions. In the first example, a `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` instance is transformed into a `Point` from a different library. Conversely, the second example details the reverse process. To implement this implicit casting, one needs to simply assign a `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` to a variable defined in another library's format.

However, it is crucial to recognize that this functionality isn't universal across all libraries. For instance, converting a `System.Drawing.PointF` into a `IronSoftware.Drawing.PointF` is not feasible, as it's not supported by `System.Drawing`. Nonetheless, transitions between `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point` and `PointF` to types in other libraries are distinctly possible. When transitioning from an `IronSoftware.Drawing.Point`, the datatype of the coordinates shifts from `System.Double` to `System.Int32`. For a `PointF`, the `System.Single` datatype is preserved after conversion. Further examples of compatible libraries include `Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Point` and `SkiaSharp.SKPointI`.
