# IronBarCode's Compatibility with macOS for .NET Development

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/docs/questions/macos/>***


IronBarCode now offers complete support for macOS (previously known as "OS X") across .NET Standard Libraries, Core applications, and .NET 5 projects.

This support extends to all macOS versions right out of the box.

Developers targeting Apple environments will not need to modify their existing code.

Our commitment to macOS support stems from the preference among many .NET developers, including our team members, to use macOS platforms like Visual Studio for Mac and JetBrains Rider for their .NET development tasks.

## Setting Up on macOS

For those looking to deploy on macOS, IronBarCode NuGet Packages are fully documented and available. You can find more details in our [IronBarCode NuGet Installation Guide](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/docs/).
